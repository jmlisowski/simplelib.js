# simplelib.js
simplelib.js is, well, a simple JS library.
You can put it in your javascript code by putting this in the main html file:
```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmlisowski/simplelib.js/main/simplelib.js"></script>
```
Or you can just download it for yourself.
### Why did you make this?
Because I could. And to make coding more easy and accessible to people. Thanks for trying out and criticism is needed as it is helpful!
