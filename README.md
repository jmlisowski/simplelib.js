# simplelib.js
simplelib.js is, well, a simple JS library.
Download the .zip file, extract it and put the simplelib.js file in the folder you are working in. You can delete the other files.
Now you can put it in your javascript code by putting this in the main html file:
```html
<script src="simplelib.js"></script>
```  
If you do not want to download the simplelib.js file you can put this into your code
```html
<script src="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jmlisowski/simplelib.js/simplelib.js"></script>
```
But take note that this will not work if you don't have internet access. On the bright side, you have automatic updates.
After you make a decision on how you are going to include simplelib.js into your code, include your main js file here:
```html
<script src="filename.js"></script>
```
you can replace filename with whatever you want, but keep the .js there and make sure to actually make that file!
### Why did I make this?
Because I could. And to make coding more easy and accessible to people. Thanks for trying out and criticism is needed as it is helpful!  

### Hey! I want to see your code!
If you want to see the library's code, it is open source(under the MIT License), and you can make changes to that code. If, however, you see something wrong with my code and want to make a pull request and edit some code, go right ahead! It is very much needed for this project to grow to it's full potential.
