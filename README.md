# simplelib.js
simplelib.js is, well, a simple JS library.
Download the .zip file, extract it and put the simplelib.js file in the folder you are working in.
Now you can put it in your javascript code by putting this in the main html file:
```html
<script src="simplelib.js"></script>
```
and include your main js file here:
```
<script src="filename.js"></script>
```
you can replace filename with whatever you want, but keep the .js there and make sure to actually make that file!
Or you can just download it for yourself.
### Why did you make this?
Because I could. And to make coding more easy and accessible to people. Thanks for trying out and criticism is needed as it is helpful!
